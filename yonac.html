        Yonac is a quick and easy-to-learn card game developed by Johann Tutor and Gaetan Boue.
        Its name is from the Japanese word for "four" and from the first two letters of "ace".
        It is inspired by the game "Ace of Spades", described in Bob Phillips' <i>Super Cool Jokes and Games for Kids</i>.<sup class="ref"><a id="backref1" href="#ref1">1</a></sup>
