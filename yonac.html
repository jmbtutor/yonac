        Yonac is a quick and easy-to-learn card game developed by Johann Tutor and Gaetan Boue.
        Its name is from the Japanese word for "four" and from the first two letters of "ace".
        It is inspired by the game "Ace of Spades", described in Bob Phillips' <i>Super Cool Jokes and Games for Kids</i>.<sup class="ref"><a id="backref1" href="#ref1">1</a></sup>

      <h2>1. Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Yonac uses a standard deck of cards (jokers optional). Any number of players may play.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rules">
      <h2>2. Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of the game is to collect as many cards as possible without collecting the Ace of Spades.
      </p>

      <section id="cards">
        <h3>2.1. The Cards</h3>

        <p>
          The four Aces (i.e. the Ace of Spades, the Ace of Hearts, the Ace of Clubs and the Ace of Diamonds) are special and are described below.
          All other cards have no special attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of the Aces, the Ace of Spades and the Ace of Diamonds take effect immediately upon collection.
          The Ace of Hearts and the Ace of Clubs take effect on a subsequent turn.
        </p>

        <section id="ace-of-spades">
          <h4>2.1.1. The Ace of Spades</h4>
          <p>
            Picking up the Ace of Spades, except when using the Ace of Clubs or the Ace of Hearts, will result in a loss.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ace-of-diamonds">
          <h4>2.1.2. The Ace of Diamonds</h4>
          <p>
            The Ace of Diamonds forces you to add more cards to the cards being evaluated.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ace-of-hearts">
          <h4>2.1.3. The Ace of Hearts</h4>
          <p>
            The Ace of Hearts allows you to pick up the Ace of Spades once without losing.
            The usage of this card is described in <a href="#spades-hearts">2.2.1.4</a>.

        <section id="ace-of-clubs">
          <h4>2.1.4. The Ace of Clubs</h4>

          <p>
            The Ace of Clubs gives you one chance to win instantly.
            The usage of this card is described in <a href="#playac">2.2.2</a>.

      <section id="gameplay">
        <h3>2.2. Gameplay</h3>

        <p>
          The game proceeds in two phases: the Elimination phase and the Sudden Death phase.
          Before starting, agree on the number of players needed to go into the Sudden Death phase; this is the Threshold.
          These phases are further discussed in <a href="#elimination">2.2.3</a> and <a href="#sudden-death">2.2.4</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the Threshold has been decided, shuffle the deck and spread the cards out on the table; this is the Pile.
          Decide on a player order.
        </p>

        <p>
          On each turn, you may do one of two actions: you may collect cards, or you may use the Ace of Clubs if you have it set aside.
        </p>

        <section id="collecting">
          <h4>2.2.1. Collecting Cards</h4>
          <p>
            Each player has a stack of cards, called the Stash, into which collected cards are put.
            Any Aces put into your Stash may not be used again until the Ace returns to the Pile.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.1.1" id="set">
            If you choose to collect cards, pick up one or more cards from the Pile and display them face-up in front of you.
            These cards are the Set for this turn.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.1.2">
            If the Set does not contain any Aces, put the Set into your Stash.
            Your turn is now over and play proceeds to the next player.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.1.3">
            If the Set contains the Ace of Spades and you do not have the Ace of Hearts set aside, you lose and all your cards are reshuffled into the Pile.
            Play proceeds to the next player.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.1.4" id="spades-hearts">
            If the Set contains the Ace of Spades and you have the Ace of Hearts set aside, place the Ace of Hearts in your Stash and reshuffle the Set into the Pile.
            The Ace of Hearts may not be used again until it returns to the Pile.
            Note that the Ace of Hearts is not treated specially if it is in the Set with the Ace of Spades;
            it must have been collected and set aside in a previous turn for this case to apply.
            Play proceeds to the next player.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.1.5">
            If the Set contains the Ace of Diamonds, pick up one or more cards from the Pile and add it to the Set.
            Re-evaluate the new Set, ignoring the Ace of Diamonds.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.1.5">
            If the Set contains the Ace of Clubs, put the Ace of Clubs aside.
            You may play it in a later turn as described in <a href="#playac">2.2.2.</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.1.6">
            If the Set contains the Ace of Hearts, put the Ace of Hearts aside.
            It will protect you if you collect the Ace of Spades in a later turn as previously described in <a href="#spades-hearts">2.2.1.4</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Put the remaining cards in the Set into your Stash.
            Your turn is now over and play proceeds to the next player.

          <h4>2.2.2. Playing the Ace of Clubs</h4>
          <p>
            If you have set aside the Ace of Clubs, you may choose to play it instead of collecting cards.
            Once played and put in your Stash, the Ace of Clubs may not be used again until it is returned to the Pile.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.2.1">
            To play the Ace of Clubs, declare that you will be playing the Ace of Clubs.
            Put the Ace of Clubs in your Stash, then pick up one card from the Pile and display it face-up in front of you.
          </p>

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.2.2">
            If the card is not an Ace, put it in your Stash.

          <p class="numbered" data-number="2.2.2.3">
            If the card is the Ace of Spades, play stops and you win the game.

            If the card is the Ace of Hearts, put it aside.

            If the card is the Ace of Diamonds, put it in your Stash
            and pick up one more card from the Pile.

        <section id="elimination">
          <h4>2.2.3. Phase 1: Elimination</h4>
          <p>
            During the Elimination phase, players who pick up the Ace of Spades and lose are eliminated.
            Play continues until the number of players left reaches the Threshold,
            at which point the Elimination phase is over and the Sudden Death phase begins.
          </p>
        </section> <!-- elimination -->

        <section id="sudden-death">
          <h4>2.2.4. Phase 2: Sudden Death</h4>
          <p>
            In the Sudden Death phase, if a player picks up the Ace of Spades and
            loses, the game ends. The remaining players will count the number of
            cards in their Stash, including any Aces set aside.
          </p>
        </section> <!-- sudden-death -->

        <section id="winning">
          <h4>2.2.5. Winning</h4>
          <p>
            There are two ways to win:
            by picking up the Ace of Spades while using the Ace of Clubs as described in <a href="#playac">2.2.2</a>,
            or by not being eliminated and having the most cards your Stash at the end of the Sudden Death phase.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a tie, the tied player who has the Ace of Hearts wins.
            If no one has the Ace of Hearts, the tied player with the Ace of Clubs wins.
            If no one has the Ace of Hearts or the Ace of Clubs, the tied player with the Ace of Diamonds wins.
            If no one has any Aces, the tied player who had a turn last wins.
            Note that if none of the remaining players have had a turn, then the player last in the queue wins.
