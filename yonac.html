        Yonac is a quick and easy-to-learn card game developed by Johann Tutor and Gaetan Boue.
        Its name is from the Japanese word for "four" and from the first two letters of "ace".
        It is inspired by the game "Ace of Spades", described in Bob Phillips' <i>Super Cool Jokes and Games for Kids</i>.<sup class="ref"><a id="backref1" href="#ref1">1</a></sup>

      <h2>1. Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Yonac uses a standard deck of cards (jokers optional). Any number of players may play.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="rules">
      <h2>2. Rules</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of the game is to collect as many cards as possible without collecting the Ace of Spades.
      </p>

      <section id="cards">
        <h3>2.1. The Cards</h3>

        <p>
          The four Aces (i.e. the Ace of Spades, the Ace of Hearts, the Ace of Clubs and the Ace of Diamonds) are special and are described below.
          All other cards have no special attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of the Aces, the Ace of Spades and the Ace of Diamonds take effect immediately upon collection.
          The Ace of Hearts and the Ace of Clubs take effect on a subsequent turn.
        </p>

        <section id="ace-of-spades">
          <h4>2.1.1. The Ace of Spades</h4>
          <p>
            Picking up the Ace of Spades, except when using the Ace of Clubs or the Ace of Hearts, will result in a loss.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ace-of-diamonds">
          <h4>2.1.2. The Ace of Diamonds</h4>
          <p>
            The Ace of Diamonds forces you to add more cards to the cards being evaluated.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ace-of-hearts">
          <h4>2.1.3. The Ace of Hearts</h4>
          <p>
            The Ace of Hearts allows you to pick up the Ace of Spades once without losing.
            The usage of this card is described in <a href="#spades-hearts">2.2.1.4</a>.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ace-of-clubs">
          <h4>2.1.4. The Ace of Clubs</h4>

          <p>
            The Ace of Clubs gives you one chance to win instantly.
            The usage of this card is described in <a href="#playac">2.2.2</a>.
          </p>

      <h2>2. Gameplay</h2>

      <p>
        The game proceeds in two phases: the Elimination phase and the Sudden Death phase.
        Before starting, agree on the number of players needed to go into the Sudden Death phase; this is the Threshold.
        These phases are further discussed in <a href="#elimination">2.2.3</a> and <a href="#sd">2.2.4</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the Threshold has been decided, shuffle the deck and spread the cards out on the table; this is the Pile.
        Decide on a player order.
      </p>

      <p>
        On each turn, you may do one of two actions: you may collect cards, or you may use the Ace of Clubs if you have it set aside.
      </p>
